# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Kadengine
Psych Kadengine, Kade Engine's input system and rating system + Psych simplicity and extra features. Perfection.

Thanks to [tposejank](https://github.com/tposejank) for extra keys modification.
You can add keys up to 10, to do this go to debug menu (press 7 in the game) and increase or decrease mania.
The song watermark is bugged, do not expect much right now!
Tankman is playable now! There is two versions, original and reanimated. Choose what you want.

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), stop using 4.1.5. Seriously, it has not any git problems anymore.
Also you need at least **4** GB RAM, if you have 2 or less it may occur an error called "**Out of heap space**".

You need these haxe libraries:

```
lime 7.9.0
openfl
flixel
hscript
newgrounds
linc_luajit
```

Here is a [tutorial](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13935) how to do this.
You DO NOT need other unnecessary Visual Studio components, just install this two:

```
MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)
```
